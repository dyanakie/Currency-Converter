## About

 The program has 2 modes.
 
 First calculates US dollars to currency of your choosing, using current rates and amount you provide.
 
 Second shows historic rates for US dollars for a multitude of currencies, for a date which you provide.
 
 It is using currencylayer.com API to fetch rates on a free account.If there is an error it is most probably due to the API key which has  expired.In that case make a free account and replace the key in src/constants.
 
 Program is built using ReactJs/Redux/Saga.
